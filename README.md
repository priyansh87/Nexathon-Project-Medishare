## Introduction

In today's fast-paced world, accessing accurate medical information and authentic medications is crucial. **MediShare** addresses these challenges by offering:

- **Comprehensive Medical Summaries**: Upload medical reports to receive concise summaries, including diagnosed conditions, prescribed medications with their uses, and personalized lifestyle suggestions.
- **Medication Verification**: Scan medication QR codes to obtain detailed information, verify authenticity via blockchain, and prevent counterfeit drug usage.
- **Community-Driven Medicine Donations**: Connect with government hospitals, NGOs, and individuals to donate or acquire unused, unexpired medications, reducing waste and promoting health equity.

## Features

### 1. Medical Report Summarization

Utilizing generative AI, our platform analyzes uploaded medical reports to provide:

- **Diagnosed Conditions**: Clear identification of medical issues.
- **Prescribed Medications**: Details of medications, their purposes, and dosages.
- **Lifestyle Suggestions**: Tailored advice to support health and well-being.

*Example*: Upload a blood test report to receive insights into cholesterol levels with dietary recommendations.

### 2. Smart Medication Scanning

Our smart scanning feature enables users to:

- **Verify Medication Authenticity**: Scan QR codes to access blockchain-stored data, ensuring the medication's legitimacy.
- **Access Detailed Information**: Learn about medication uses, side effects, and guidelines.
- **Prevent Counterfeit Consumption**: Blockchain integration safeguards against fake medicines, promoting user safety.

*Example*: Before consuming a medication, scan its QR code to confirm its authenticity and access usage instructions.

### 3. Medicine Donation Network

**MediShare** fosters a community of care by enabling:

- **Donations of Unused Medications**: Individuals can donate unexpired medicines to those in need.
- **Collaboration with Hospitals and NGOs**: Streamlined processes for organizations to distribute medications effectively.
- **Duplication Prevention**: Blockchain ensures transparent tracking, preventing duplicate donations and misuse.

*Example*: A person with surplus medication can list it on the platform, allowing nearby hospitals or individuals to claim and utilize it appropriately.

### 4. AI-Powered Chatbot (RAG-Based)
MediShare includes an intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot to enhance user interaction and support. This chatbot is capable of:

Context-Aware Assistance: Understands platform policies, user queries, and donation workflows.

Real-Time Recommendations: Provides suggestions based on available medicines in the donation database, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.

Document + Data Integration: Combines knowledge from uploaded reports and live backend data to offer highly personalized responses.

üîß Powered By:

Groq API with Gamma Model: For fast and efficient natural language understanding.

FAISS Vector Database: To index and retrieve contextual data from donation records and policies.

LLaMA Embeddings: Used to convert textual data (like reports and medicines) into vector format for smarter retrieval.

Example: A user asks, ‚ÄúCan I donate expired medicine?‚Äù ‚Äî the chatbot fetches policy context and responds accurately. Or, if asked, ‚ÄúWhich painkillers are currently available for donation?‚Äù ‚Äî it checks live data and replies accordingly.
